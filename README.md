# CDCL-SAT-solver

## Running
mycompile.sh does nothing as our solver is written in python.
The solver has been tested using python3.6 on the CSE lab machines. 

benchmark.sh was used to run all the benchmarking tests.

Both benchmark.sh and myrun.sh assume python3.6 is installed. They may work for some other versions of python3 but this is not guaranteed.
